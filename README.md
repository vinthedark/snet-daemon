SingularityNET Daemon
The daemon is the adapter with which an otherwise SingularityNET-unaware service implementation can be exposed to the SingularityNET platform. It is designed to be deployed as a sidecar proxy alongside the service on a given host.
The daemon abstracts the blockchain components away from the clients.
The SNET Daemon interacts with the Multi Party Escrow to facilitate authorization and payment for services and acts as a passthrough for making API calls to the service.The daemon is the endpoint a client will submit requests to, and they are then passed to the service after validation by the daemon.


## Channel Claim command
Gets the latest channel state of the Channel updated in ETCD by the daemons of the same group and then increments the nonce of the channel.
It then sends and ON-Chain transaction to claim funds.The daemons continue their work independently without any confirmation from the treasurer on the blockchain.
